title: The properties and evolution of magnetised cold filaments
 in a cool-core cluster

event: Galaxy Clusters and Radio Relics II 
event_url: https://galaxy-clusters-radio-relics-2.sites.cfa.harvard.edu/home

location: Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian
address:
  street: 60 Garden St
  city: Cambridge
  region: MA
  postcode: '02138'
  country: United States

summary: I presented the results of my recent paper on the multiphase intracluster medium. This was my first time in the US!
abstract: 'I discuss the role of magnetic fields in the formation of cold filaments in cool-core clusters. I show that these are critical to obtain realistic filament morphologies. I then discuss the coupling between these cold clumps of gas and the outflowing AGN jets.'
